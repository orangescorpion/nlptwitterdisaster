Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started) is an ongoing Kaggle competition for newcomers to Kaggle and ML beginners. This project contains my solution.

# Modules used
## Pandas
The development of pandas began in 2008 and is now an open-source project aimed at being the most powerful data analysis/manipulation tool. It has its own DataFrame object and is capable of reading and writing files as well as pivoting, merging, indexing, and subsetting datasets.

## scikit-learn
Scikit-learn (aka sklearn) is an open source machine learning module for Python, built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. Its functions include data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, model selection, clustering, regression, and classification. This includes support vector machines and neural networks.

## nltk
Natural Language Toolkit is a platform for natural language processing with libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.

# Data processing
## Dealing with capitalization
Since ML models will treat capital letters as distinct characters from lowercase letters, the words "Book" and "book" would be counted as two separate words in model training. Although capitalisation can sometimes provide clues about sentiment (e.g. ALL CAPS OFTEN SIGNIFIES STRONG EMOTION), in this case all characters will be converted to lowercase for the benefit of matching words.

## Punctuation
When separating a sentence into separate words to create word count vectors, spaces are used to distinguish separate words. So a sentence like "sadly, I won't be here" would turn into the array ["sadly,", "I", "won't", "be", "here"]. Evidently, "sadly," includes the comma which would make it a different word from "sadly". For this reason, punctuation is removed as part of the data cleaning stage. Important to note that if all punctuation is removed, words like "o'clock" will become "oclock".
